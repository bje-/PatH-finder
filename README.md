Passivhaus Pathfinder tool for the southern hemisphere
======================================================

A [Solar Pathfinder](https://solarpathfinder.com) device can take out
the guesswork of estimating shading reduction factors for windows and
opaque building surfaces in Passive Houses. These improved reduction
factors can then be entered directly into PHPP.

The Excel spreadsheet in this repository is a modified version of the
spreadsheet produced by the [Passive House Institute
US](http://www.phius.org/). This modified version includes the sunpath
diagram data for the southern hemisphere. Thank you to [The
SolarPathfinder Company](https://www.solarpathfinder.com) for
providing sunpath diagrams for the full range of southern latitudes.

The first worksheet in the workbook (Introduction) provides basic
instructions you can refer to as you work. For full details of the
protocol, you should read the PDF in the **1. Instructions** folder of
the Zip file linked from:
